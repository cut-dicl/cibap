This code written by SHERAZ ASLAM for the article titled "Aslam, Sheraz, Michalis P. Michaelides, and Herodotos Herodotou. "Dynamic and Continuous Berth Allocation Using Cuckoo Search Optimization." (2021)."


1. This is the main file to only run "Cuckoo_GA_MILP_V2.m".
2. This code contain multiple .m files but these are called in main file automatically, not need to execute.

If you are using my code please cite my work as:
